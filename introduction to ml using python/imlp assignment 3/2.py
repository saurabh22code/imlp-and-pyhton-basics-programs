'''Q.2.What are the different of files
Files can be broadly categorized into two main types based on their content and structure:
1. Text Files
•	Description: These files contain data that is readable as plain text, typically encoded in formats like ASCII or UTF-8.
•	Examples:
o	.txt (plain text files)
o	.csv (Comma-Separated Values)
o	.log (log files)
o	.xml, .json, .html (structured text files)
•	Usage: Text files are commonly used to store human-readable data, such as configurations, logs, or structured data like JSON or CSV.
•	Operations in Python:
o	Read with read(), readline(), readlines()
o	Write with write() or writelines()

2. Binary Files
•	Description: These files contain data in binary (machine-readable) format, which may not be directly human-readable.
•	Examples:
o	.jpg, .png, .gif (image files)
o	.mp3, .wav (audio files)
o	.mp4, .mkv (video files)
o	.exe (executable files)
o	.dat, .bin (generic binary data files)
•	Usage: Binary files are used for multimedia, executable programs, or any data that requires precise encoding.
•	Operations in Python:
o	Open with 'b' mode (e.g., 'rb' for reading, 'wb' for writing)
o	Data is handled as bytes, not strings'''
